# Encoding CwFs in Homotopy Type Theory
#### 15 Oct 2020

Consider the problem of defining models of type theory *inside* HoTT.
A bit of work has been done on this:

- *[Shallow embedding of type theory is morally correct [KKK18]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.0756)*
- *[Internal âˆž-Categorical Models of Dependent Type Theory: Towards 2LTT Eating HoTT [Kr20]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01883)*

It seems natural to consider two particular varieties of CwF internal to type theory: the set-truncated and "$\infty$-" (i.e. with all higher coherences) versions.
For the references listed above, the first is formulated in an extensional metatheory and is automatically truncated, while the second is $\infty$-.

For this note we'll focus on the set-truncated version.
