Consider the problem of defining models of type theory inside HoTT.
In particular, we want an internal definition of a *category with families* (CwF).
A bit of work has been done on this:

- [*Shallow embedding of type theory is morally correct* [KKK18]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.0756)
- [*Internal âˆž-Categorical Models of Dependent Type Theory: Towards 2LTT Eating HoTT* [Kr20]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01883)

and in the paper which introduces CwFs:

- [Internal Type Theory [Dy96]](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~peterd/papers/InternalTT.pdf)

It seems natural to consider two particular varieties of CwF internal to type theory: the set-truncated and "$\infty$-" (i.e. with all higher coherences) versions.
For the references listed above, the first is formulated in an extensional metatheory and is automatically truncated, while the second is $\infty$-.

For this note we'll focus on the set-truncated version.
